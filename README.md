## Structure and styles

How you lay out this repository and how the site looks are up to you. We've added a couple of files already so you can see how we suggest laying out the learnings from each week. If you'd rather structure the repository differently, you're welcome to.

You might like to host this repository on GitHub pages and contain your project sites inside this single repository.

You might prefer to create each site in its own repository and link to them from this central directory.
